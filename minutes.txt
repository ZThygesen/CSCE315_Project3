SCRUM 1 (11/28)
We started by talking about what we have left to do for the remainder 
of the Sprint. Zach also talked about implementing OAuth. Mainly, he 
discussed that it may be more difficult than initially thought and 
that it might get in the way during development. Zach and Ardian then 
went over Google Translate and the problems the team is having with 
implementing it. We also discussed how we need to delete branches after 
theyâ€™ve been merged in the main branch.  We concluded by talking about 
the tasks remaining for the rest of the Sprint and the fact that we might 
need to push implementing OAuth to Sprint 3.

SCRUM 2 (11/30)
We started by discussing our findings from the expert panel assignment. 
We then accounted for these findings in our backlog and task list. 
Justin then assigned the team tasks for the remainder of Sprint 3. 
Zach mentioned that he was unable to complete the OAuth implementation 
for Sprint 2 due to the difficulty of the implementation, and we all 
agreed that it can be completed for Sprint 3. We concluded by scheduling 
the remainder of the SCRUM meetings for the semester (11/30, 12/2).

SCRUM 3 (12/2)
We started by discussing our findings from the expert panel assignment. 
We then accounted for these findings in our backlog and task list.
